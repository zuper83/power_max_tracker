# Agents Used in Development

This Home Assistant custom component was developed with assistance from AI agents and development tools. Below is a list of the primary agents and tools used during the development process:

## AI Agents

- **GitHub Copilot**: An AI-powered code completion and generation tool provided by GitHub. It was used extensively for:
  - Generating initial code structures and boilerplate
  - Debugging and fixing issues in the sensor logic
  - Implementing persistence mechanisms for sensor state
  - Optimizing code for performance and correctness
  - Providing explanations and suggestions for Home Assistant integration patterns

## Development Tools

- **Home Assistant Core**: The underlying platform for testing and validating the custom component
- **Python**: The primary programming language used
- **VS Code**: The integrated development environment used for editing and managing the codebase
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration

## Development Process

The development followed an iterative approach with AI assistance:
1. Initial component setup and sensor creation
2. Implementation of core functionality (max tracking, averages)
3. Addition of features like monthly resets and attributes
4. Debugging and optimization of state persistence
5. Documentation and testing
